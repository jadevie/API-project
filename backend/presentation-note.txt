Here are possible topics to talk about or demonstrate for an endpoint:

What you struggled with most when implementing the endpoint
-- Edit a booking endpoint: I was testing the booking to check for error and really struggle to put my understanding about date into code.


Was there something that you really struggled with and had to come up with a creative solution for?
-- Get all Spots route: I can't get limit and offset to work with eager loading, so I did some research and found out that sequelize don't allow some implementation that use Limit and offset with subquery so I set it to false and it works


Is there something that you're excited about working on more in the future?
-- I'm excited to work with React to see how my application will work with UI


Is there any code logic or syntax that you're proud of?
-- get reviews of current user: eager loading syntax with subqueries


Is there any section of code that you think is particularly clean/maintainable?
-- Add an image: router.post('/:reviewId/images

Was there anything you did to make the code DRYer?
-- Get all reviews of current user: I could eager loading it to make it more efficient
